Such chaos interest of users to use maps . NGOs also plan important role in today’s world as the cost of medical facilities have skyrocketed . It has also increased people interest in social services there is also an increased need of blood and medical services.Selecting this POI’s will not only be helpful for public domain as it will display only healthcare services but it will also benefit business or industry is solving for providing a solution and humanitarian and business way.   We have selected hospitals as main POI’s which are then bifurcated as government,private and here affiliated hospitals.Blood banks &amp; medicals near each hospital are also included which forms other components. Our Maps make it easy for searching emergency services related/near to hospitals.There is no unwanted data shown on the maps which are confusing it also helps in customised searching.This is not only a humanitarian but also business approach to a project.   Private hospitals can take this up display their own chain of hospitals and other services that they provide.Government itself can take it up for public interest which will raise public engagement and make it easy for technically  inmature crowd to use maps.A brand chain can use this map to show only their brand components.From a larger point of view, making this project more complex can also helped us to create our own version of 911.Here can use this map to make it easy for their employees to search for hospitals/medical services that they are affiliated with.
